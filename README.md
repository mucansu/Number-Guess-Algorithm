# Python Automated Number Guesser

This project implements an automated number guessing game using the binary search algorithm. Given a secret number between a specified range, the automated guesser attempts to identify the secret number with the least number of tries.

## Features

- Uses binary search strategy for efficient guessing.
- Provides statistics including success rate, average attempts needed, and maximum attempts taken.
- Configurable range for secret number generation.


### Configuration

- Modify `test_numbers` to adjust the number of tests/scenarios.
- Adjust `min_num` and `max_num` to set the range for secret number generation.

## Results

The game outputs:
- The success rate of the guesser.
- Average number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
- Maximum number of attempts taken in all runs.
